 Method Structure
 In Java, we use getters and setters to follow the principle of encapsulation, which is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).Getters and setters provide controlled access to these fields
 If you only provide a getter, the field becomes read-only from outside.
 If you only provide a setter, it becomes write-only.
 The id field is often considered a unique identifier for each student.for this we wont use setter method
